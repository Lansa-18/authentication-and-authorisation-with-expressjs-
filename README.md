### Challenge PART2
### Explain if this requirement **“This delete user functionality can be done after authentication”** is a good idea or a bad idea based on your gained knowledge about authentication and authorisation and add additional explanation why these two concepts are different.

# What is **Authentication and Authorization** all about?
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It answers the question, "Are you who you say you are?" This step typically involves the user providing credentials, such as a username and password, to confirm their identity.
- Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action. It answers the question, "Are you allowed to do what you’re trying to do?" For example, even after a user has been authenticated, they might only have permission to view certain resources but not modify or delete them.

# Evaluation
- The requirement that the **delete user functionality can be done after authentication** is not inherently bad. However, it’s crucial to understand that authentication alone is not sufficient to determine whether a user should be able to perform such a critical action.
- **Why Authentication Alone Isn’t Enough:** Authentication only verifies that the user is who they claim to be. It does not determine what actions they are allowed to perform. In the context of deleting a user, merely confirming the user’s identity does not guarantee that they have the right to delete that user, especially if it involves deleting another user's account.

# The Importance of Authorization
- **Authorization checks are crucial** in this scenario to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can delete a user account. For example, while a user should be able to delete their own account, they should not be able to delete another user’s account unless they have the appropriate administrative privileges.
- **Potential Risks Without Proper Authorization:** Allowing a user to delete accounts based solely on authentication could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as users deleting accounts they shouldn’t have access to. This could lead to data loss, security breaches, and compromised system integrity.

- In conclusion, while allowing a user to delete their account after authentication is acceptable, it’s essential to couple this with strong authorization checks. Ensuring that only authorized users can perform account deletions is vital to maintaining the security and integrity of the system. Therefore, the focus should be on implementing both authentication and authorization processes correctly to avoid any potential misuse of the functionality.
